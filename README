# Hi there, thanks for visiting

# In my daily work as SysOp I encounter problems that need to be investigated and solved
# One way of doing this is trying to (re)create environments in VirtualBox and test applications and configurations
# Or sometimes doing extensive research to master scripting languages

# I use Windows10 as my Vagrant host
# I use VirtualBox to host CentOS8 and/or Fedora32 nodes to test ansible or bash scripts
# I hope you enjoy my scripts and look forward to your testing, itterations and comments

# I'll be working on 4 public branches:

# Vagrant scripts for VirtualBox
# Ansible scripts for CentOS
# Bash scripts for CentOS
# Powershell scripts for Windows

# Cheers
